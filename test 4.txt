Dynamite Rave!


Techno, rave
It's time to make a stand
N pave the way
Some might say
Let it go,
Stay with the flow
Stay on bead,
Move your feet
On concrete
Or on the dance floor
You want more
Then I'll give you more
If it's too hard core
Let me know
I stop the show
Then bring it back
To be exact
At 12 o'clock
Rock the spot
It's too damn hot
They told me so
To make a move
DYNAMITE RAVE
It's on the down low
Use your inner glow
To make a move
Show n prove
The man with the lisp
Sounds so crisp
When you can see me on TV
On the radio
Here me blow
